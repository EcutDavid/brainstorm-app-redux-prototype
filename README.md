=====================
These are the beginnigs of a brainstorming app using redux, react and d3 in a
hot reload environment. Used in a presentation at Shanghai JS meetup to
demonstrate redux for rapid prototyping.

Slides for the talk are in [the .pptx](Rapid app prototyping with shorter development cycles.pptx)

The repository has several branches showing progress from nothing to somewhat
functional prototype indicated on the slides.

If you want to add improvements issues or PRs are welcome.
